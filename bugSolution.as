The solution is to explicitly check for null before accessing the property:

```actionscript
var myObject:MyObject = getMyObject();
if (myObject != null) {
  var value:String = myObject.myProperty;
} else {
  // Handle the case where myObject is null
  trace("myObject is null");
  var value:String = ""; // or some default value
}
```

This revised code first verifies that `myObject` is not null before attempting to access `myProperty`. If `myObject` is null, the code executes an alternative path, preventing the exception and allowing for graceful handling of the null case.
